We could go on and on this topic, but the short answer is ****"Start Now."****

What we mean by that in a way that would probably benefit you, even if you're not a teenager. This is a perfect time to start your road to living a successful life. You're not paying rent. You've got so much time on your hands that if you start now, you'll get a massive advantage over everyone else.

The easiest way to start is by reading a book on ****[self-help topics](__GHOST_URL__/7-life-changing-books/)**** or on a subject you really are ****passionate about****. Find an entrepreneur or person who's already achieved that status you're shooting for, and start analyzing them learn their story. What they did, how they did it, what were their circumstances, and more absorb as much knowledge as possible about the industry you're passionate about. You're already reading this article, so props to you on that. That's really something.

How many people your age do you think spend their time educating themselves at this young age? There are so many distractions around you that it's really easy to get sidetracked statistically. A large amount of free time wasted by teenagers is in the following categories watching entertainment, gaming for entertainment purposes, and spending time on social media.  What do these three have in common? They're all for entertainment purposes, and you do them to feel good. Now, before you go off on us in the comments. There's nothing wrong with entertainment consumption or with gaming. But just how much time are you wasting?

Look at it like this if you had a big box of donuts in front of you with 1000 donuts. The first one you take out is the best-tasting one. The second one is also good, but just a little bit less good than the first one. The third one is good but less than the previous one. As you keep going through the donuts, the satisfaction with each piece decreases even up to a point where if you keep consuming, you'll be sick. The same principle applies to entertainment. Never settle for mediocrity. Consume entertainment occasionally. And when you do it just with the best you want to watch a TV show watch only the ones that have the ****biggest budgets or that everyone agrees they're amazing****. You want to play some PUBG or NFS, do so with your friends. But remember that each game can go for around 30 to 40 minutes; add those up, and you can easily waste a couple of hours.

Use entertainment as a reward only after you're done with your studies. And by this, we don't mean homework; you'll reward yourself with ****high-quality entertainment**** if you start managing your time just a little bit better, then ****start putting in some work reading the**** [****right books****](__GHOST_URL__/7-life-changing-books/) ****or reading some industry news about your passion****. That means what big players are up to these days and even getting your hands a little bit dirty trying to emulate them. You've got a great future ahead of you. Just don't think it's going to happen overnight.
