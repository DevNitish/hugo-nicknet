      <description>What’s in it for me? Learn to learn better. It is believed that if you want to be a master in your field, you have to be a born genius, have an outstanding memory, or, a least, be willing to become a bookworm. Right?Well, not quite. You don’t have to next Einstein or Newton to become an efficient learner. All you need is a set of specific skills to master the art of learning.</description>

      <description>“A reader lives a thousand lives before he dies . . . The man who never reads lives only one.” – George R.R. Martin
Books are the best way to learn from the best people who walked the Earth. Think of this in this way, a man who publishes a book spends decades before writing it down. And he puts down the best learning he had in those days. So by reading a book, you get the exact knowledge in just a couple of days.</description>
