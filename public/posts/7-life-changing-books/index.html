Martin\nBooks are the best way to learn from the best people who walked the Earth. Think of this in this way, a man who publishes a book spends decades before writing it down. And he puts down the best learning he had in those days. So by reading a book, you get the exact knowledge in just a couple of days.\nSo here I am sharing my top 7 books which changed my life and if you read them I am 100 percent sure, will change yours too.\n1.How to Win Friends and Influence People by Dale Carnegie\nIt’s probably the most recommended self-improvement book out there. And there’s a reason for this. See, what this book does is it teaches you simple little rules to keep in mind for social interactions. I don’t want to spoil the book for you. But there are certain things that you can do that will drastically increase your ability to befriend people. The book essentially teaches you how to become more likable. And that’s one of the most powerful skills out there. Because if you can get people to like you, then things will start to go your way, you’ll find that you have an easier time making friends, getting jobs, making sales. And one of the great side effects of all of this is that you will be much happier. And here’s something to think about. When you learn how to make friends. You’re essentially learning how to make others happy. And this is one of the most fulfilling feelings out there, the ability to spread joy and that’s what, How to win friends and influence people is on top of my must-read list.\n2.Rich Dad Poor Dad by Robert T. Kiyosaki\nIt’s the only book on wealth that I have on this list. And there’s a reason for that Rich Dad, Poor Dad teaches you a very simple mindset that will quite literally change your life. It’s a mindset that makes a lot of sense. But no one ever talks about it. It’s not taught in school, it’s not talked about in the media. My friends, my parents didn’t know about it. I know I’m beating around the bush by not telling you what this mindset is, but I don’t want to spoil the book for you. It’s honestly super easy. It’s a short book, and I was able to finish it in just one day.\n3.The Power of Habit by Charles Duhigg\nThis is a book that helps me to make good habits. Of course, this book is a must-read, because it teaches you about how habits work. See our destiny, what we accomplish in life is ultimately determined by what sort of habits we have. If we have a bunch of bad habits, then chances are we’re not going anywhere, anytime soon. During breaks down exactly how habits work and what you can do to change them. The more you understand why and how your addiction works, the inner workings of all habits than the more things you can do to overcome it. A very important book for anyone that wants to change their life.\n4.The Power of Now by Eckhart Tolle\nI’ll be honest, the premise of this book is pretty weird. Eckhart was a man in his late 20s, became fed up with life, and claims to have spent a month just sitting on a park bench in a state of bliss. He talks about the root of all suffering, why so many of us feel miserable about our lives. Why do we like to argue with our loved ones, why we can’t find happiness. The book is written in a rather odd format, every couple of pages, it prompts for you to set the book down and think about what you just read. I had many, many breakthroughs, the first time I ever read this book. It drastically changed the way I view the world and I can proudly say that it’s made me a happier person.\n5.A Mind for Numbers Barbara Oakley\nThis is a book that taught me How to learn. Barbara failed Maths and Science in middle school. She didn’t think she had the natural talent for that. But at an age of 26, she decides to teach herself Maths and Science. She followed certain techniques that helped her to learn much faster. Barbara became a professor of engineering ultimately because she learned that she could learn anything when she was equipped with the right learning techniques. Among all the learning techniques in this book, the one that stands out above all the rest is having the ability to frequently switch between focus and diffuse modes of thinking. It is a must-read book for students.\nThe 5 Second Rule by Mel Robbins So how many of us out there have goals and what stands in the way between our goals and obtaining success from those goals. Well, for me, the one thing that seems to stand in my own way is myself but after reading this book I have definitely discovered a tool that will help me achieve these goals. I’m looking to achieve my own personal life. In this book, Mel talks about meta-cognition and how it affects our deciding making system. This book talks about how to start now to achieve your dream.\nThe 4-Hour Work Week by Tim Ferriss The tagline of this book sounds too good to be true. But this book is packed with some of the techniques that will help you to really achieve a 4-Hour workweek. One of the main concepts the book talks about is the difference between Absolute vs Relative income. This basically means it doesn’t matter how much we earn annually but how much we are earning her hour. That’s the thing that matters the most. This book also has many ways to automate tasks which gives you more time to spend time on what you care about the most. Overall this is a very good read for the people who want to become an entrepreneur one day.\nConclusion:\nIf this is the first time you are trying to read a self-help book, I would highly recommend starting with “The Power of Habits” followed by “The 5 Second Rule”. Both books are short and interesting to read. This pair of books will get the ball rolling for your success.\nComment below and let me know any book you want me to read.\n",

<p>Books are the best way to learn from the best people who walked the Earth. Think of this in this way, a man who publishes a book spends decades before writing it down. And he puts down the best learning he had in those days. So by reading a book, you get the exact knowledge in just a couple of days.</p>

<p>The tagline of this book sounds too good to be true. But this book is packed with some of the techniques that will help you to really achieve a 4-Hour workweek. One of the main concepts the book talks about is the difference between Absolute vs Relative income. This basically means it doesn&rsquo;t matter how much we earn annually but how much we are earning her hour. That&rsquo;s the thing that matters the most. This book also has many ways to automate tasks which gives you more time to spend time on what you care about the most. Overall this is a very good read for the people who want to become an entrepreneur one day.</p>
<p><strong><strong>Conclusion:</strong></strong></p>
<p>If this is the first time you are trying to read a self-help book, I would highly recommend starting with &ldquo;The Power of Habits&rdquo; followed by &ldquo;The 5 Second Rule&rdquo;.
